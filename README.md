I used the "cors" library because of the Same-Origin Policy that is built into browsers. Using this library, I allowed requests from different sources. Origins is the name given to the combination of protocol, subdomain, domain and port.
Example: ``https://mySite.com:80``

The Same-Origin security policy is a security mechanism implemented by web browsers that restricts interactions between different origins (that is, different schemes, hosts, and ports) on the web. This means that a script on one web page can only access resources on another page if they both have the same origin.

This security policy helps prevent attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and session information theft by preventing malicious scripts from accessing sensitive information on other pages. Without this restriction, a script could easily access user information on other web pages and use it for malicious purposes.

There are some exceptions to the Same-Origin policy, such as allowing cross-access between trusted sites using the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) feature. However, this policy is generally enforced to protect user security when accessing the web.
